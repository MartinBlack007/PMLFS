This repository contains the code for the paper **"Integrating Label Confidence-based Feature Selection for Partial Multi-Label Learning"**.

## Overview

In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method that integrates label confidence to enhance the performance of partial multi-label learning. Our approach focuses on selecting features that are most relevant to confident labels, thereby improving the accuracy and interpretability of multi-label classification models.
